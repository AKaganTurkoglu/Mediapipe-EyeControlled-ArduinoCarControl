# Mediapipe-EyeControlled-ArduinoCarControl
This project uses the MediaPipe library for eye tracking to control an Arduino car. It detects gaze direction (up, down, left, right, or center) and sends the most frequently detected direction within a 1-second interval to the car. This method is implemented to minimize error possibilities in car control.
